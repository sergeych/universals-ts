/**
 * Arbitrary sync and async ring buffer. ring buffers provide more effective storage for fast changed data as it does
 * not allocate dynamic data except for async operations. Async operations wait until the data or space will be
 * available respectively, providing awaitable promises. Sync operations are very efficient and return operation's
 * result that signal not data/no space available as need .
 *
 * _Important note_: `RingBuffer` _can't be used to store `undefined`s but can store `null`s_. This is because
 * `undefined` is used to mark lack of data (for example for closed buffers).
 *
 * RingBuffer also could be used to exchange data between async processes and as an async iterable source. In that
 * case use [[close]] to stop receivers from waiting for incoming data. Here is the sample:
 * ```
 * const rb = new RingBuffer<number>(3);
 *
 * rb.put(1)
 * rb.put(2)
 * rb.put(3)
 * // more than capacity: this will create promises, e.g. async operation will be nequeued:
 * rb.put(4)
 * // closing will not clear hanging asyn writes
 * rb.close();
 *
 * for(let i=0;i<10; i++) {
 *    const x = await rb.get();
 *    if( i < 4 ) expect(x).toBe(i+1)
 *    else expect(x).toBeUndefined()
 * }
 * ```
